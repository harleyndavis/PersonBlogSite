This started as my working through a UDEMY course MERN Stack Front To Back: Full Stack React, Redux & Node.js 
found here https://www.udemy.com/share/101WIoAEcedF9VQnQ=/

I extended on this base code to set up a personal website with the goal of being a blog.

It uses the MERN stack with MongoDB for storing data.

Everything is created and managed on site through an admin page. 

Can register users for purpose of commenting on posts.
